Phase 3 Interview Challenge B

This is the challenge for getting into phase 3. There are 3 parts to the challenge.

To get started, create a new repository called phase-3-challenge. Do all of your work in this repo and submit it as your solution.

Skills covered:

Programming
Programming in JS
Node.js
HTTP
HTTP Applications
HTML & CSS
The Browser
SQL
Each requirement has a point value. A fully complete requirement gets full points; partially complete requirements get partial points; incomplete requirements get no points. Completeness is determined by calculating points earned divided by total points available.

General Requirements

 10: Solution is in a public repository called phase-3-challenge.
 10: Solution repository has 3 folders: part-1, part-2, and part-3.
 10: Solution repository includes a .gitignore ignoring files that don't shouldn't be committed (e.g. node_modules/, *.log files).
 10: Parts 1 and 2 have their own package.json specifying dependencies.
 20: Git history shows frequent commits.
Part 1: Simple web app

Build a very basic web API which conforms to the routes listed below.

Use Express. You don't need to use an HTML templater like EJS or Pug, just respond with plain text. (You can use curl or Postman to check whether the routes work)

The web server should provide the following routes:

GET /api/days/:day
POST /api/array/concat
Route 1: GET /api/days/:day

Your application should define an object called daysOfWeek

daysOfWeek = {monday: 1, tuesday:2, wednesday: 3, thursday: 4, friday: 5, saturday: 6, sunday: 7}
The response is determined by looking up the url param passed into the route :day from the daysOfWeek object. An example will make this clearer -

request: GET /api/days/wednesday
response: 3
status: 200

request: GET /api/days/friday
response: 5
status: 200

request: GET /api/days/holiday
response: `'holiday' is not a valid day!`
status: 400
Route 2: POST /api/array/concat

Example requests

request: POST /api/array/concat
request body params: {"array1": [1,3],
                      "array2": [5,6]}
request content type: application/json
response: {"result": [1,3,5,6]}

request: POST /api/array/concat
request body params: {"array1": "abcd",
                      "array2": [5,6]}
request content type: application/json
response status code: 400
response: {"error": "Input data should be of type Array."}
Requirements

 10: All files are stored under the part-1/ folder
 10: All dependencies are specified in a package.json file
 10: Web server can be started with npm start command
 20: GET requests to the /api/days/:day route responds with content type application/text, as described in the example above
 80: POST requests to the /api/array/concat, concatenates the two arrays provided in the request body and responds with the result. An invalid array should return a 400 response.
Part 2: Command Line Grocery Store

Build a command line tool that emulates a grocery store. The tool will interact with a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve information. You will have to desgin a database to store grocery items, shoppers, and orders. Let's call the database grocery_store.

You'll need to design the schema and write some SQL statements to insert data. Look closely at the commands and their sample outputs to determine how to design your schema.

Write a command line script called store that retrieves information from the database

The store command should support the following sub commands:

command	description	example usage
product-list	lists all products which belong to the given section	./store product-list <product-section>
shopper-orders	lists the orders for a given shopper	./store shopper-orders <shopper-id>
real-shoppers	lists the names of all shoppers who have atleast 1 order	./store real-shoppers
Example Usage

Note: The example output below is not exactly what you would see in reality. (Since the output would depend on the seed data that you add to your database) Use the output below as a template for how each command should display the data.

List all products from a section

$ ./store product-list dairy
|--------------+---------+
| Product Name | Section |
|--------------+---------+
| Butter       | dairy   |
| Cheese       | dairy   |
| Cream Cheese | dairy   |
| Eggs         | dairy   |
| Milk         | dairy   |
| Sour Cream   | dairy   |
| Yogurt       | dairy   |
|--------------+---------+
List all orders for a given shopper id, returns the order id, and the total cost of the order.

$ ./store shopper-orders 1
|----------+------------|
| order id | total cost |
|----------+------------|
|        1 |      27.99 |
|        4 |      18.75 |
|----------+------------|
List all the shoppers that have atleast 1 order, and also display the number of orders for them.

$ ./store real-shoppers
|--------------+------------------|
| shopper name | number of orders |
|--------------+------------------|
| Shanti       |                1 |
| Mary         |                2 |
| Justin       |                2 |
|--------------+------------------|
Requirements

 10: All files are stored under the part-2/ folder
 10: Database schema (all CREATE TABLE statements) is defined in a file schema.sql
 10: SQL script to insert grocery seed data and load from CSV is created in a file load-data.sql
 10: SQL statements to insert data into the orders and shoppers table is added to the file load-data.sql. (Add at least 5 rows in each table)
 10: All database query functions are written in a file database.js, and tests for queries are written in a file database_test.js
 10: Tests can be run with the command $ npm test
User Stories: Ensure that your schema design can satisfy the following scenarios

 10: As a shopper I can fetch all my orders
 10: As a shopper I can have multiple items in an order. (Assume the quantity of each item is always 1)
Command line interface requirements

 10: Create a command line Node script called store.js
 20: Command product-list has been implemented
 40: Command shopper-orders has been implemented
 30: Command real-shoppers has been implemented
Write tests with Mocha + Chai in database_test.js that assert:

 20: The database function for the command product-list is tested
 20: The database function for the command shopper-orders is tested
 20: The database function for the command real-shoppers is tested
Part 3: Web interface for grocery store

Create a front-end only site for an online grocery store where users can choose from a list of items and add them to a cart.

You only need to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No web server is required.

The initial layout has already been provided for you in the grocer.html and grocer.css files. From this base, build the modal and add interactive behavior with JS.

Note that this interface has been intentionally simplified for the purposes of this challenge: for example, when adding multiple items it will just duplicate the same item instead of adding to a quantity.

Wireframe

Clicking on the "Cart" button opens the cart modal.

Requirements

 10: All files are stored under the part-3/ folder
 20: No third party CSS or JS libraries are used (all code must be written from scratch)
 10: HTML, CSS, and JS are separated into their own files.
 20: Clicking on a section in the "Sections" sidebar will jump to that section in the page
 20: Clicking on "Add to cart" will update the number displayed next to the "Cart" button to show the total number of items in the user's cart
 20: Clicking on the "Cart" button will show the cart modal with a list of all items added
 20: Clicking on the "Clear" button in the cart modal removes all items from the cart
 20: Clicking on the "X" button in the cart modal closes the modal
 20: The "Total" in the cart modal shows the calculated sum of all item prices
